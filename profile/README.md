## Background

At Facet AI, we're on a journey to democratize small language model (SLM) fine-tuning. SLMs are geting more and more powerful, with new use caes emerging day by day. We hope that as more people start training SLM for their own task and domain specific adaptations, advancements in AI can more rapidly translate to real-world impact across industries and communities.

## Authors
